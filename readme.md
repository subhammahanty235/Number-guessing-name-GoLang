Number Guessing Game
    This is a simple number guessing game written in Go. The game generates a random number within a given range, and the player must guess what that number is. The player is given feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low until they guess the correct number.

How to play
    When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter the starting and ending numbers of the range. The random number generated by the program will be within this range.

    Next, you will be prompted to enter your guess. If your guess is too high or too low, the program will let you know. You can keep guessing until you get the correct answer.

    When you have successfully guessed the number, the program will let you know and tell you how many guesses it took you.

Code Overview
    The program starts by importing the fmt and math/rand packages, which are used for printing to the console and generating random numbers, respectively.
    The main function is where the game logic is contained.
    The user is prompted to enter the starting and ending numbers of the range.
    A random number is generated within this range using the rand.Intn function.
    A loop is used to repeatedly prompt the user to enter their guess, and the player is given feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low until they guess the correct number.
    The program keeps track of the number of guesses using the noofguess variable, which is incremented with each incorrect guess.
    Once the player has correctly guessed the number, the program prints a message to the console and the game ends.
